# Jonathan McDowell Dataset Analysis
Google sheets is terrible software once you reach 10000 lines, excel too

Going to manually write the csv analysis library and use plotly for display. Must be end-to-end, start with a natural language prompt, get a chart as a result in a couple of iterations. 

TODO:
1. Add psatcat and sites and orgs datasets in separate files
2. Create example chart csv outputs for google sheets graphs
3. Use plotly to create a chart from the csv output
4. Make plotly beautiful
